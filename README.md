In this homework assigment, The Task was to use PostgreSQL to make querys about a variety of given CSV files. First, I developed the ERD using 
https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ and then used the schema it provided to make the correct tables in PostgreSQL. After uploading the corresponding CSV files to the 
appropriate tables, I then followed the directions to create several queries to view different tables.
